If you use your own templates, you need to modify them accordingly, or the output will be broken.

- Invalid seminar IDs in the URL are now better handled in the detailed view and the registration form: with an error message and a HTTP status of 404 (so that search engines don't index the invalid URLs).

- If no user is logged in, a link to the login form is now provided.
- If there are no events for the list view, now a message gets displayed instead of an empty list.
