To-do list and milestone plan for tx_seminars
=============================================

For this extension, there are still many unimplemented feature ideas. Help is very welcome! Contact the author if you want to help in any way.

If you find any bugs in this extension, please report them in the Typo3 bugtracker under the project tx_seminars.
